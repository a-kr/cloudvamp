1. INSTALLATION

1.1 REQUISITES

CVEM is based on python, so Python 2.6 or higher runtime and standard library must
be installed in the system.

1.2 INSTALLING

1.2.1 GETTING CloudVAMP FROM GIT

Download CloudVAMP from git:
  
$ cd /tmp
$ git clone https://github.com/grycap/cloudvamp
    
or

$ cd /tmp 
$ wget https://github.com/grycap/cloudvamp/archive/master.zip
$ unzip cloudvamp-master.zip
$ mv cloudvamp-master cloudvamp

1.2.1 INSTALL IN SYSTEM PATH

Enter the CVEM directory in the downloaded files and perform the setup installation.

$ cd /tmp/cloudvamp/cvem
$ python setup install

1.2.2 INSTALL IN A SPECIFIC PATH

Select a proper path where to install the CVEM service (i.e. /usr/local/cvem, 
/opt/cvem or other). This path will be called CVEM_PATH.

$ cp -r cd /tmp/cloudvamp/cvem /usr/local

Finally you must copy (or link) $CVEM_PATH/scripts/cvem file to /etc/init.d directory.

$ ln -s /usr/local/cvem/scripts/cvem /etc/init.d

1.3 CONFIGURATION

In case that you want the CVEM service to be started at boot time, you must 
execute the next set of commands:

On Debian Systems:

$ chkconfig cvem on

On RedHat Systems:

$ update-rc.d cvem start 99 2 3 4 5 . stop 05 0 1 6 .

Or you can do it manually:

$ ln -s /etc/init.d/cvem /etc/rc2.d/S99cvem
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/cvem /etc/rc3.d/S99cvem
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/cvem /etc/rc5.d/S99cvem
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/cvem /etc/rc1.d/K05cvem
$ ln -s /etc/init.d/cvem /etc/rc6.d/K05cvem

Adjust the installation path by setting the DAEMON variable at /etc/init.d/cvem 
to the path where the CVEM cvemd.py file is installed (e.g. /usr/local/cvem/cvemd.py),
or set the name of the script file (cvemd.py) if the file is in the PATH.

Finally edit the configurations files *.cfg located in the etc/ directory where the 
CVEM is installed (e.g /opt/cvem/etc) or in the /etc/cvem directory:
	* cvem.cfg: CVEM configuration file.
	* one.cfg: OpenNebula specific configuration file.
